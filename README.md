# Mn_3_X_Hall
Mathematica routines which calculate the Hall angle change with strain and magnetic field, The diles included are:

1. strain_details_OT_conv : This notebook calculates the free energy in terms of the normal modes and determines the Hall angle for a 
                            particular value and angle of the strain vector. Also calculates the corresponding strain induced magnetization.

2. strain_misaligned_out_of_plane : This notebook calculates the effect of a non coplanar strain.
